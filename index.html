                                    In accordance with the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act (FAST) of 2015,
                                    DVRPC has been evaluating multimodal access to tourist destinations in Greater
                                    Philadelphia. The tourism and hospitality industry represents a growing part of the
                                    region's economy. Each dollar spent by travelers generates additional expenditures
                                    in indirect spending and is indirectly responsible for the creation of numerous
                                    additional jobs. Published in 2017, DVRPC's
                                    <a href="https://www.dvrpc.org/Reports/DS17050.pdf"><em>Hospitality &amp; Tourism

                                    illustrates the economic impact of the tourism industry. The region's tourist
                                    attractions are generally well served by the existing transportation network, and
                                    numerous improvements in recent years have enhanced the ability of tourists to
                                    access these destinations.
                                </p>

                                    Reasons for traveling can be for leisure, visiting friends or family, or
                                    job-related. To keep visitors returning to the region, it is important to make sure
                                    that tourist attractions are easily accessible through a variety of transportation
                                    modes. DVRPC published an initial report on the importance of tourism and
                                    accessibility in 1997,
                                    <a href="https://www.dvrpc.org/Reports/97012.pdf"><em>How Do We Get

                                <p>DVRPC's focus in the tourism space is ensuring multimodal accessibility to tourist
                                    attractions to ensure a positive
                                    experience for the visitor. Approximately 58% of the region's economic impact of
                                    tourism occurs in the City of
                                    Philadelphia, followed by Bucks and Montgomery counties but how are visitors getting
                                    to these attractions outside Center
                                    City? Are they accessible via transit or trail? In 2018, DVRPC compiled information
                                    about how visitors were accessing

                                    Prior to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the tourism and
                                    hospitality industry represented a growing
                                    part of Greater Philadelphia’s economy. As such, staff evaluated how the locations
                                    and scale of the region’s primary
                                    tourist destinations, the number of employees working in hospitality and tourism,
                                    and a change in travel patterns may
                                    have impacted this sector. This <a

                                    quantifies the pandemic’s impact(s) on a
                                    specific sector of the region’s
                                    hospitality and tourism industry, the traveler accommodations sector, which includes
                                    companies within the 7211
                                    four-digit North American Industry Classification System [NAICS] code such as
                                    hotels, motels, casino hotels, bed and
                                    breakfast inns, guest houses, housekeeping cottages and cabins, and youth hostels.
                                    An analysis of three standard metrics
                                    within the traveler accommodations sector—occupancy rates, average daily rate (ADR),
                                    and revenue per available room
                                    (RevPAR)—will demonstrate how tourists’ locational preferences for traveler
                                    accommodations changed during the pandemic,
                                    and leave the region with points to consider as it enters into a period of
                                    post-pandemic economic recovery

                                <h2 class="tourism-yearly">Ferry Service Feasibility</h2>
                                <p>
                                    Greater Philadelphia has a long history of ferries dating back to the 17th century.
                                    Prior to bridges, tunnels, and
                                    expressways, ferries were essential to move throughout the region and played a key
                                    role in the formation of towns and
                                    cities. During the 20th century, however, the development of bridges like the Ben
                                    Franklin Bridge (1926), Tacony-Palmyra
                                    Bridge (1929), and the Walt Whitman Bridge (1957) led to the decline of ferry
                                    services in the region (Nepa 2015).
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Previously evaluated in 2007, potential ferry service identified opportunities for
                                    new ferry service between Gloucester
                                    County and points of interest in Pennsylvania. The potential benefits and challenges
                                    outlined in the 2007 study include
                                    an alternative form of transportation, reduced air pollution and congestion,
                                    increased connectivity, and support for
                                    existing and new development. Potential challenges include parking availability,
                                    increased traffic in local communities,
                                    the competitive cost of driving, access to Center City Philadelphia, and funding.

                                    To further enhance the accessibility of tourist destinations between Old City and
                                    the New Jersey portion of the region,
                                    staff explored the feasibility of adding a seasonal ferry service as an additional
                                    transportation option to promote
                                    tourism. Published in November 2022, the <a
